# Introduction
Introduction to ZIX: a SaaS starter built with Next.js and Supabase
MakerKit is the Next.js boilerplate project for SaaS built to get you started on the right foot.

The MakerKit kit is a fully-featured Next.js application that uses Supabase for authentication, database (with Postgres), and storage.

This version of the kit uses the new App Router introduced with Next.js 13, which is built on top of the new React Server Components.
